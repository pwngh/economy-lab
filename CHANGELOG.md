# Changelog

Notable changes to `@pwngh/economy-lab`, newest first. Dates are npm publish dates.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-16

### Added

- `/store-kit` entry point for custom store authors: the chain, encoding, and ordering
  helpers.
- Submit metrics: operations counted by kind and outcome, and timed.
- The background worker's sweep input accepts an optional reconcile feed.
- The subscription price band is configuration (`SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_MIN_MINOR`,
  `SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_MAX_MINOR`).

### Changed

- Rejections carry structured detail: `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` reports `required` and
  `available`, `FUNDS_IMMATURE` reports `availableAt`, and `RISK_DENIED` reports `spent`,
  `limit`, `windowMs`, and `retryAfter`.
- Subscription charges run behind the maturity gate: immature funds defer the renewal,
  insufficient funds lapse it.

### Fixed

- Redelivered payout settlements are idempotent: a second `settlePayout` or `reversePayout`
  delivery returns the original outcome.
- Injected services are shape-checked at wiring time; the payout dead-letter log fires after
  commit.

### Documentation

- The handbook covers redelivered settlements and the payout saga's row key.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-15

Initial release: one double-entry ledger carrying wallets, payouts, subscriptions, and a
marketplace; in-memory, Postgres, MySQL, and HTTP stores held to one conformance suite; the
HTTP service; the background worker; and the compiled dist build with per-entry-point exports.
